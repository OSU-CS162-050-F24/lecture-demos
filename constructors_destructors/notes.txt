Constructors: A special member function that's automatically called
	whenever an object is declared. Used to "set up" the
	object.
Destructors: A special member function that's automatically called
	whenever an object is freed from memory. Used to "tear down"
	the object.

The default constructor for a class or structure type will automatically be
generated for you by your compiler if and only if you didn't define ANY
constructors for that class or structure type. These "default default constructors"
are empty and do nothing.
