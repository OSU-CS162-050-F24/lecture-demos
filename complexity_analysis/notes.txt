Task: Sort a list of N integers

You have to choose an algorithm. Ideal: Try them all! In practice, we can't
try all of them. So instead, we've found ways to DESCRIBE the properties
(runtime, space) of algorithms so that we can compare them without testing them.

Describing runtime in a meaningful way is difficult.

It takes insertion sort 0.01 * N^2 seconds on some particular piece of hardware
with some very particular unsorted list.

Complexity analysis very LOOSELY is used to describe these properties.
More specifically, complexities measure rates of growth.

"Insertion sort performs a certain number of operations that is proportional to N^2"



We'll measure two kinds of complexities:
- Runtime complexity
- Space complexity
