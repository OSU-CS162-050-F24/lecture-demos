Composition: A "has-a" relationship between data
	A person "has-a" name
	A person "has-a" age
	A directory "has-a" list of people

Composition hierarchy: A description of all of the data types and the
	data that they're composed of in a program

Coupling: In order to change one piece of code, you have to change
	one or more other pieces of code

Interface: The part of the component of code that other components of
	code directly interact with

Our goals w.r.t. coupling:
1. Reduce coupling
2. Isolate coupling
3. Make it so that the components of code that are most likely to
	need to change are subject to the least amount of coupling

Tools to achieve our goals:
1. Encapsulation: Co-locating data (variables) and behavior that
	operates on that data (functions)
2. Information hiding (classes and objects)
